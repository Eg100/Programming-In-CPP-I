a) Comment out using namespace std
   It will not be compiled 
   error: cout, endl, cin, string was not declared in the scope
   suggested alternative: std::cout, std::endl, std::cin,
                          std::__cxx11::string.

b) Remove Critter:: prefix in one of the methods
   I am removing the prefix in the first method(setName())
   error: ‘name’ was not declared in this scope
   We should specify the name of the class it belongs to
